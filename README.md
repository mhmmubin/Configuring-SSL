How to create a self signed certificate using OpenSSL


SSL stands for Secure Socket Layer and is an encryption framework which can be used on individual network connections. In addition, to securing data against eavesdropping, it also allows one to authenticate a network connection on one or both sides using a public key infrastructure. 

Commercial systems are using digital certificates from certification authorities, i.e. VerySign but for test purpose we will create via OpenSSL.
